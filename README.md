determ-pwgen
============

A deterministic password generator

You'll only have to remember one password / seed and can use it to generate a unique password for many websites or programs

Version2
========

Generated passwords are now shorter, by using both lower- and uppercase characters (and different from version 1).
Please use version 1 to recover the old passwords and move to version 2.
